I am a Lecturer at Dallas College and recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University (October 2025). My research lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence**, **computer vision**, **Large Language Models**, and **transportation systems**, with additional expertise in **quantum computing** applications.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on developing AI-driven solutions for safety-critical systems, with particular emphasis on:

- **Computer Vision & Video Analytics**: Developing advanced systems for crash detection, temporal action localization, and traffic analysis using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures
- **Large Language Models**: Integrating LLMs with computer vision for automated narrative generation and enhanced understanding of visual data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Creating intelligent decision-making systems for autonomous vehicles and biomedical applications
- **Quantum Neural Networks**: Pioneering quantum computing approaches for enhanced security and anomaly detection in next-generation networks
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Building simulation frameworks for traffic safety analysis and predictive modeling

## Recent Highlights

- **Multiple Conference Acceptances (2025)**: Papers accepted to ECAI, EMNLP, and ITSC
- **Industry Experience**: Applied Scientist Internship at Amazon (Summer 2025), developing Knowledge Graph frameworks
- **Academic Service**: Reviewer for premier conferences including CVPR, ITSC, ACM Multimedia, WACV, and ICLR
- **Interdisciplinary Impact**: Research spanning transportation safety, biomedical engineering, and quantum computing

## Current Position

As a Lecturer at Dallas College, I teach computer science courses and continue my research in AI and machine learning. I am passionate about making complex technical concepts accessible to students and fostering the next generation of computer scientists.

I am open to research collaborations and consulting opportunities in AI, computer vision, and transportation systems. Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
