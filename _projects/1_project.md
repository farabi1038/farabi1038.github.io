This project, funded by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT), focuses on developing AI-based navigation systems for snowplow operations under extreme weather conditions.

## Key Components

### Real-Time Crash Detection
Developed computer vision algorithms for detecting traffic incidents in real-time from dashboard cameras mounted on snowplows. The system uses state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to identify crashes even under poor visibility conditions.

### ADAS Enhancement
Enhanced Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to function reliably in extreme weather, including:
- Snow and ice detection
- Reduced visibility compensation
- Lane detection in adverse conditions

### Video Analytics
Implemented sophisticated video analytics pipelines that process hours of footage to extract meaningful insights about road conditions and traffic patterns during winter operations.

## Impact

This research directly contributes to improved safety for snowplow operators and other road users during winter weather events. The systems developed are being tested in real-world conditions on Iowa highways.
