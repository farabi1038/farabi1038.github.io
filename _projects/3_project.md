This research explores the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) for enhanced security and privacy in next-generation (7G) networks.

## Overview

As networks evolve towards 7G technology, traditional security approaches may not be sufficient. This project leverages quantum computing to develop novel security architectures.

## Key Contributions

### Quantum-Driven Zero Trust Architecture
Developed a quantum-enhanced zero trust framework that uses QNNs for:
- Dynamic anomaly detection
- Real-time threat assessment
- Quantum-resistant authentication

### Performance Improvements
Achieved a **10% increase in anomaly detection accuracy** compared to classical neural network approaches, while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Technical Implementation
- **Frameworks**: torchquantum, Qiskit, PennyLane
- **Architecture**: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
- **Applications**: Network intrusion detection, traffic analysis, privacy preservation

## Publications

Published in **Measurement: Digitalization** journal (2025):
*"Quantum-driven Zero Trust Architecture with Dynamic Anomaly Detection in 7G Technology: A Neural Network Approach"*

## Impact

This work establishes new methodologies for quantum-driven security frameworks that can be applied to emerging network technologies and critical infrastructure protection.

## Ongoing Work

- Few-shot learning for quantum spin systems (HMAE framework, accepted to ECAI 2025)
- Scaling quantum algorithms for larger network deployments
- Integration with existing security infrastructure
